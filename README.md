# Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks

## HTML/CSS challenge project #1

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. It's based on the design files found at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

I'm working through these challenges to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS, familiarise myself with a typical front end web developer's workflow, and get comfortable with using git and github.

JPEG design mockups for the desktop and mobile presentations of the site were found at the link above, alongside a style guide and images. Everything else here is my own work, seeking to utilise HTML, CSS and responsive web design techniques to replicate the design mockups.
